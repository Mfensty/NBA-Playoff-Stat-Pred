*Note: Date is the when the data is edited. Players have been removed when teams lost, as they can no longer be factored in.*

*Available options for players include Jayson Tatum, Jaylen Brown, Jrue Holiday, Derrick White, Luka Doncic, Kyrie Irving, PJ Washington, Derick Lively, Daniel Gafford, Josh Green, Anthony Edwards, KAT, Jaden McDaniels, Rudy Gobert, and Mike Conley.*
